// a custom React Hook named useFetch designed to handle
// fetching data from a specified URL.

// This imports the useEffect and useState hooks from the React library. These hooks are essential for managing side effects and state
// within functional components, respectively.

import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

// This defines a function called useFetch which takes a url parameter.
// This function is a custom React Hook.

const useFetch = (url) => {
  // initializes a state variable data using the useState hook.
  // The initial value of data is null.
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  // This useEffect hook runs after every render of the component, but because of the dependency array ([url]),
  // it only executes if the url parameter changes.
  //  Once the response is received, it parses the JSON content and updates the data state with the fetched products.

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url).then((res) => {
      res.json().then((result) => {
        setData(result.products)
      })
    })
  }, [url])

  // Finally, the hook returns the data state variable,
  // which contains the fetched products. Any component using this hook will have access to the fetched data.
  return data
}

export default useFetch

// The fetch() function initiates an HTTP request to the specified URL. In this case, it's using the url parameter
// passed to the useFetch hook. When the fetch() function is called, it returns a promise. This promise resolves with a
// Response object representing the response to the request.

// The .then() method is used to handle the promise returned by fetch().
//  Within the .then() method, the response object (res) is passed, and
//  another .then() method is chained to parse the response body as JSON.
//  Once the JSON data is parsed, it's accessible through the result
//  variable.

// Finally, the setData() function is called to update the state variable
//  data with the fetched products, which are assumed to be stored in the
//  result.products property.

// So, while the code snippet doesn't explicitly mention "HTTP request",
// the fetch() function is indeed used to make the request to the
// specified URL and retrieve data asynchronously.
